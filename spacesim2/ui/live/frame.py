"""The immutable per-turn frame the renderer reads from.

The simulation mutates freely inside ``run_turn`` (deferred market matching,
inventory transfers, ship movement), so the render thread must never look at
live ``Planet`` / ``Actor`` / ``Ship`` / ``Market`` objects. Instead the
simulation worker builds one :class:`TurnFrame` at each turn boundary and
publishes it by reference swap; readers hold a frozen object and need no lock.

A frame carries only what the screen shows: one small snapshot per planet and
ship, the galaxy vitals for the HUD, and drill-down details for the entities the
UI has *subscribed* to (the current selection) — never a copy of the whole sim.
The per-planet wellbeing sweep (every actor's drives) is the one expensive part
of building a frame, so it is computed once here and shared with the history
recorder.
