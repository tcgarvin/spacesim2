"""Turn pacing and anti-slideshow ship interpolation.

The simulation advances in discrete turns on the worker thread, but we render
at ~60fps. The director converts real elapsed time into turn *requests*
(``turns_per_second``) and, between published frames, interpolates each ship's
*map position* between the previous and the latest
:class:`~spacesim2.ui.live.frame.TurnFrame` so ships glide smoothly instead of
teleporting. The director never touches the simulation itself.

Interpolating position (rather than ``travel_progress``) is deliberate: when a
ship arrives, the core resets progress to 0, so interpolating progress would slide
the ship backwards. Positions go origin->along-route->dest monotonically, so a
position lerp always reads as forward motion.
