"""Per-turn time-series recorder feeding the live charts.

Each planet market keeps unbounded per-turn ``price_history`` and
``volume_history``. The live charts need three things those lists lack: a
bounded window so a long session cannot grow without limit, a galaxy-wide
aggregate across every market, and a citizen-wellbeing series, which the core
does not record. :class:`HistoryRecorder` samples all three once per turn into
ring buffers the renderer reads each frame without touching core internals.

The :class:`~spacesim2.ui.live.worker.SimulationWorker` calls :meth:`record`
on the simulation thread after each ``run_turn``, and :meth:`sample` once at
startup for a turn-0 baseline. Charts read from the render thread, so a lock
serializes writes against the list copies readers take. Nothing here mutates
the simulation.
