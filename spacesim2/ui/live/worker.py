"""Runs simulation turns off the render thread and publishes frames.

The contract between the UI and the simulation is deliberately thin:

* The worker owns the mutable simulation. ``run_turn`` and every snapshot
  builder run under ``_sim_lock`` on the worker thread; the render thread reads
  only :attr:`SimulationWorker.latest_frame`, an immutable
  :class:`~spacesim2.ui.live.frame.TurnFrame` swapped in by reference.
* The director paces turns by calling :meth:`request_turn`; the worker runs
  at most one turn at a time and remembers at most one pending request, so a
  simulation slower than the requested rate simply runs flat out instead of
  building up a burst of catch-up turns that would freeze the window.
* Drill-down detail is a *subscription*. The scene subscribes to its selection;
  every published frame carries details for the subscribed entities only. A
  subscription made while the worker is idle (paused, or between turns) is
  serviced immediately under the lock so the panel opens without waiting for
  the next turn; one made mid-turn is picked up at the turn boundary.

Without :meth:`start` the worker is synchronous — :meth:`request_turn` runs the
turn on the calling thread. That is the headless/test mode, and it keeps tests
deterministic without sleeping on a thread.
