class BrainCache:
    """Per-actor-turn memoization for market quotes and cost/yield math.

    Each brain owns one ``BrainCache``, created lazily by
    ``ActorBrain._turn_cache``. It lives for a whole actor-turn, across both
    ``decide_economic_action`` and ``decide_market_actions``.

    Invalidation. ``refresh`` compares a snapshot key on every top-level
    ``decide_*`` entry:

    * ``sim.current_turn`` changed: everything is cleared. Between sim turns
      other actors trade, orders match, and prices move.
    * Same turn but the actor key ``(id(actor), inventory.version,
      skills_version)`` changed: only the actor-state group is cleared. The
      market never mutates between the two ``decide_*`` calls of one
      actor-turn. ``Actor.take_turn`` executes the economic command in
      between, and economic commands touch only inventory, skills, and
      money, never the order books. A ``ProcessCommand`` does change
      inventory and skills, which the version counters detect.

    Cached values fall into four groups by what invalidates them:

    * Market-derived, valid for the whole sim turn: ``bid_ask``,
      ``avg_price``, ``process_quote_values`` (per-process input cost and
      output value at current quotes; no skill or inventory inputs, so it
      survives both mid-turn bumps; see colonist.py), and
      ``replacement_quote_parts`` (per-process quoted base input cost plus
      the amortized quoted price of every required tool). The tool prices
      cover all tools regardless of ownership. Ownership is
      inventory-dependent and is applied per call in ``_replacement_cost``,
      never baked in here.
    * Skill-derived, valid until the actor's skills change, surviving turn
      boundaries and inventory changes: ``skill_factor``. Skill ratings are
      the only input, and ``skills_version`` tracks them.
    * Valuation, derived from quotes and skills but not inventory:
      ``ranked_profits``, the colonist's whole-registry profitability scan
      filtered to entries clearing the government-work bar and still
      pre-``can_execute`` (see colonist.py). Dropped on turn change or
      skill change, kept across the inventory-only bump the economic
      command causes mid-turn. That is what spares
      ``decide_market_actions`` a second full registry scan.
    * Actor-state-derived, also invalidated when inventory or skills
      change: ``replacement_cost``, ``imputed_cost``, ``netback_value``, and
      ``best_result``. They read tool/facility ownership or
      ``can_execute_process``.

    ``yield_modifier`` is outside all groups and is never reset. It depends
    only on the planet's attributes, fixed for the run, and the process,
    and an actor never changes planet.

    Money and drive metrics are not cached here, so they need no
    versioning. Keys are commodity/process ``id`` strings.

        ``labor_opportunity_cost``, not the flat government wage: the turn
        is worth what the actor's next-best process earns, and that is what
        a purchase saves. Pricing then follows the rest of this method:
        take a local ask at or under the ceiling, otherwise rest a bid at
        the reference price escalated by scarcity pressure and capped by
        the ceiling.

        Quantity. One run's base output per material, less whatever the
        drive passes above already bid for that material, so the total
        quantity resting in it is the larger of the two. The budget is the
        caller's remaining money, so this never outbids an unmet need.

        Recorded goods that no drive consumes, directly or as an input to a
        drive material's recipe, draw no bid: this raises no price for a
        good the actor is not hand-making for itself.
