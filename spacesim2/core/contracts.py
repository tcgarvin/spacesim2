"""Contracts: paid transport jobs a ship carries for someone else.

One data type, ``Contract``, covers every job a ship can be paid to fly:
a migrant's passage, an abstract government freight lot, and later real
goods. Core owns what a contract *does*; brains own whether to post one
and whether to accept one, the same split as migration and market orders.
Nothing in this module decides anything.

Lifecycle:

===============================  =====================================
Call                             Effect
===============================  =====================================
``board.post(contract)``         reserve the poster's money, OPEN
``board.accept(contract, ship)`` ACCEPTED, counts against the hold
``load_contract(ship, c)``       payload boards, advance paid, LOADED
``deliver_contract(ship, c)``    payload delivered, on_delivery paid
``board.release(contract)``      an ACCEPTED contract back to OPEN
``board.cancel(contract)``       an OPEN contract off the board
``board.expire(turn)``           OPEN contracts past expiry, EXPIRED
``strand_contract(ship, c, p)``  payload unloaded short of destination
===============================  =====================================

Money. An actor poster reserves ``advance + on_delivery`` at posting, the
way a bid reserves money, and gets it back on cancel, expiry, or the
refund half of a stranding. The government reserves nothing; its payouts
are created, the same way the government wage is. Every payment goes to
the carrier in full.

A contract lives on its origin planet's board from posting until it is
delivered, cancelled, or expired, so core functions reach the board
through ``contract.origin.contracts``.
