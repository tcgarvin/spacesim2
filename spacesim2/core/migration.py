"""Migration: the mechanics of an actor moving between planets.

The split is deliberate. Brains decide whether, when, and where an actor
moves (``ActorBrain.decide_migration``); this module and the simulation own
what a move does. Nothing here reads a drive or a price to decide anything.

Flow:

1. During its turn an actor's brain returns a ``MigrationRequest`` or
   ``NO_MIGRATION``. ``Actor.take_turn`` stores the result on
   ``actor.migration_request``. The actor phase is threaded by planet, so
   nothing moves here.
2. After the ship phase and before market matching,
   ``run_migration_phase`` turns each standing request into an open passage
   contract on the origin planet's board, re-prices one the actor has
   raised its offer on, and cancels one the actor no longer wants. Nobody
   moves here either.
3. A ship brain accepts the contract, and ``Ship.start_journey`` loads the
   passenger: the actor leaves its planet and ``sim.actors``, travels with
   nothing, and the fare is paid to the carrier.
4. ``Ship.update_journey`` delivers on arrival, which calls
   ``relocate_actor``: the actor joins the destination with the land the
   load claimed for it and a fresh brain cache, and its brain's
   ``on_relocated`` hook runs.

A passenger aboard a ship is in neither ``sim.actors`` nor any
``planet.actors``, which keeps the ``core/parallel.py`` invariant that the
two cover each other. Its ``planet`` still points at the origin;
``actor.in_transit`` is the authoritative flag.

``refresh_planet_stats`` builds one ``PlanetStats`` per planet at the start
of each turn so brains can score destinations without walking every actor.
The stats are mechanical aggregates only; how to weigh them is brain logic.
