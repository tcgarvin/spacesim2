"""Galaxy geometry and fuel-reachability facts shared by ship planning.

A :class:`Navigator` holds the galaxy-wide facts every ship would otherwise
recompute per candidate planet per commodity:

- Geometry, fixed after setup: a lazily built all-pairs shortest-route
  matrix over the star-lane network in ``core/galaxy.py``, the waypoints of
  those routes, and per-planet proximity orderings. Computed once per
  simulation and shared by every ship. Ships fly only along lanes, so
  distance throughout ship planning means lane-route length, never
  straight-line distance.
- Market-derived facts, which change as brains post orders: fuel
  purchasability, nearest-fuel-source distances, the galaxy fuel price
  reference, and the trade-signal index of per-planet commodity summaries
  and per-commodity ranked demand shortlists. These are cached per turn:
  ship brains call :meth:`Navigator.refresh_market_facts` with the current
  turn number, which rebuilds the snapshot only on the turn's first call, so
  every ship planning that turn shares one view of the galaxy. Order
  execution is deferred to end-of-turn matching, so the snapshot stays a
  valid superset filter for the whole turn; plan evaluation re-verifies
  exact prices against the live books anyway.

Use :func:`get_navigator` to obtain the per-simulation shared instance.

        """Price for a standing fuel bid at ``planet`` that makes delivery pay.

        Anchors on the cheapest *fillable producer* ask anywhere else in the
        galaxy plus the deliverer's round-trip burn at worst-case efficiency,
        amortized over ``quantity``, marked up by :data:`FUEL_BID_MARGIN` so
        the delivery clears the arbitrage threshold a trader applies. With no
        ask anywhere, falls back to :meth:`local_fuel_reference_price`.

        Fillable means the source's resting ask depth covers ``quantity``. Top
        of book alone is a bad anchor: market makers post one-unit discovery
        asks at a few credits, and a galaxy-wide minimum over those prices a
        40-unit delivery as if it could be bought for 2 credits a unit, which
        no deliverer would ever accept.

        Producer means the ask was not posted by a SERVICE actor. A dealer's
        ask is a markup on its own cost basis, and that basis comes from
        buying at exactly this delivered price: anchoring on it closes a
        feedback loop where each operator's bid raises the next operator's
        anchor, which raised the galaxy fuel VWAP sixfold over a hundred turns
        with no change in real supply. A ship's tank fuel is not a dealer ask
        and still anchors, because it is real supply someone chose to carry.

        Preference order: producer asks deep enough to fill the order, then
        producer asks of any depth, then - only when the galaxy holds no
        producer ask at all - any ask, deep ones first, and finally the local
        reference price.

        Lives on the navigator rather than on a ship because it is a fact
        about the galaxy's fuel geography, and both a stranded ship and a
        spaceport operator need the same number.

        Args:
            planet: Where the bid would rest, i.e. the delivery destination.
            quantity: Units bid for; the round trip is amortized over it, so
                a bigger bid tolerates a lower price per unit. Also the depth
                a source must have to count as fillable.
