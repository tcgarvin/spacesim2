"""Spiral-galaxy layout and the star-lane network ships travel along.

Planets used to float on an open plane where any planet could fly directly to
any other. This module replaces that with a **graph**: planets sit on the arms
of a spiral galaxy and are joined by star lanes. Ships can only travel along
lanes, so the distance between two planets is the length of the shortest lane
route between them (see :class:`~spacesim2.core.navigation.Navigator`), not the
straight-line distance.

Two structural guarantees matter to the rest of the simulation and are covered
by tests:

- **Connected**: every planet can reach every other planet (no islands).
- **Planar**: no two lanes cross. Lanes are a subset of the Delaunay
  triangulation of the planet positions, and Delaunay edges never cross.

The layout is built in three steps, all in :func:`generate_spiral_layout`:

1. Scatter planets along ``arms`` logarithmic-spiral arms with a small core.
2. Triangulate them (Bowyer-Watson Delaunay, pure Python; n <= ~500 is fine).
3. Keep the minimum spanning tree (connectivity) plus a random fraction of the
   remaining Delaunay edges that pass the Gabriel test (short, local lanes),
   controlled by ``lane_density``.

:class:`StarLaneNetwork` is the runtime object the simulation holds: it maps
:class:`~spacesim2.core.planet.Planet` objects to their lane neighbours.
