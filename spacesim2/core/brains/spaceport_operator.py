"""The spaceport operator: a service brain that deals fuel from a facility.

The gap this fills is a coordination failure, not a production one (see
``docs/spaceport-design.md``). Industrialists list fuel at an honest
replacement-cost floor that only ships ever bid for, and stranded ships post
rescue bids too small to be worth a delivery. The operator is the standing
counterparty between them: it bids at a price a producer or a deliverer will
actually take, and asks at what restocking would cost it today plus a spread,
so a docking ship always has somewhere to refuel.

It is a *service* actor, so it does not eat: its only need is keeping its
spaceport maintained, expressed as a ``FacilityUpkeepDrive``. Condition scales
how much it will sell and, below a floor, withdraws its ask entirely. That is
the whole consequence of neglect: no bankruptcy, just a port that stops being
a fuel source.
