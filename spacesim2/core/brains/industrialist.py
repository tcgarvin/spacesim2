# Procurement bids for recipe inputs have two layers, mirroring the
# consumer-side design in ActorBrain._drive_buy_commands:
#
# 1. A ceiling, the netback value of the input. It is what one unit can be
#    worth to this actor given what the recipe's output sells for: the run's
#    output value, less every other cost of the run, divided by the units
#    consumed and by ENTRY_MARGIN so the recipe still clears its entry
#    threshold after paying the ceiling. This is what carries a demand signal
#    down a tier: a medicine maker bidding 140 for medicine can pay far more
#    for refined_chemicals than the chemicals' own stale average says.
# 2. A posted bid that starts at a reference price and escalates toward the
#    ceiling as the market's scarcity pressure grows, so a bid only rises
#    where demand is actually going unfilled.
#
# The ceiling needs both an output value and an imputed recipe cost. When
# either is unavailable the bid falls back to the older single-layer pricing
# below, so the netback layer is strictly additive.
#
# Premium over imputed cost when resting a procurement bid for a never-traded
# input. Must exceed ENTRY_MARGIN: suppliers impute about the same cost we do,
# so a lower bid never triggers supplier entry and the cold-start standoff
# moves one tier up the chain.
PROCUREMENT_BOOTSTRAP_MARGIN = 1.25
# Gate for paying that premium on a good that HAS traded before. It applies
# only on the fallback path; where a netback ceiling exists, scarcity pressure
# escalates the bid continuously instead. Once a good has any trade history
# the bid would otherwise rest at the stale average, which can sit below every
# potential supplier's entry threshold, so the tier
# stays dead even though the average says a price exists. The premium is
# applied again only where the market itself says the good is unobtainable:
# no resting ask, chronic unmet demand, and essentially no recent turnover.
# Applying it unconditionally also unblocks the chain but bids up goods that

# speculative chain price ore at a hundred times its extraction cost on the
# strength of one recipe's imagined output value. Three leaves room above

# high are entry-consistent but they let scarcity pressure run to its full
# range on goods with inelastic supply, and simple_building_materials is also
# the shelter material, so colonists were outbid for housing. Two matches the

        The top of book overstates demand for a thin market. A market maker
        seeds an illiquid good with one-unit probes an order of magnitude
        above fair value; read as the price of a whole run they pull the
        population into producing something nobody buys. So how much of the
        book to believe depends on how much the good actually trades:

        1. Liquid good, one whose recent turnover already exceeds this run's
           output: the top bid is backed by flow, and is used as is.
        2. Thin good: the mean fill price of sweeping the book for the run,
           with each level clipped at the higher of the level that absorbs
           the run and ``NEVER_TRADED_VALUE_CAP`` over make cost. A lone
           discovery probe far above cost is clipped to the real demand
           under it; two real bids from a downstream producer over a
           1-credit floor are not thrown away, which valuing at the last
           level hit did (rare earth scored -273 under a live 321 bid).
        3. Thin good with a book too shallow to absorb a run at all: recent
           traded price. It sells, just not this much right now.
        4. Never traded: the only demand signal is a buyer's resting
           procurement bid, so it is honoured, but capped at a margin over
           what the good costs to make. That admits the bootstrap bid
           ``_buy_command`` rests for a cold-start intermediate, which is
           priced off the same imputation, while a discovery probe far above
           any production cost is not mistaken for demand. Refusing to value
           this case at all would re-open the producer/consumer standoff (see
           the decision log).

        Tiers 2-4 all price the good off its own thin book, which is circular
        for a raw material nobody has bought yet: the ore is cheap because no
        refiner exists, and no miner enters because the ore is cheap. So
        outside the liquid case the value is the larger of the tier price and
        the netback value, what the best downstream consumer of the good
        could pay for a unit and still enter its own recipe. See
