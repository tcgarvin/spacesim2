"""Migration reasoning: when an actor wants to leave, and for where.

``core/migration.py`` executes a move and knows nothing about why. Every
reason lives here, as plain functions both ``ColonistBrain`` and
``IndustrialistBrain`` call. Neither inherits from anything in this module.

The shape of the decision:

1. Pressure. One number in [0, 1] summarizing how badly the actor's current
   planet is serving it: unmet needs, missing prosperity, and land worse
   than the planet's own average.
2. A staggered check. Scoring 100 planets every turn for every actor is not
   affordable, so each actor scores only on the turns matching its own
   offset, once every ``MIGRATION_CHECK_INTERVAL``.
3. An intent, with hysteresis. Crossing ``ENTER_THRESHOLD`` on a check, and
   passing a propensity-weighted roll, starts an intent to leave. Falling
   below ``EXIT_THRESHOLD`` on a later check ends it. The gap between the
   two stops an actor thrashing on drive noise.
4. A waiting period. The actor holds the intent for ``MIN_INTENT_TURNS``
   before it asks to depart, which is the window in which it liquidates
   what it cannot carry and saves the fare.
5. A request, repeated every turn until core executes it.
