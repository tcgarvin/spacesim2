"""Reusable dealer algorithms shared by service brains.

These are plain functions, not a base class: each service brain (market maker,
spaceport operator) keeps its own class and its own state, and calls in here for
the pieces they genuinely share — reading their own fills off the market's
transaction history, skewing a quote by inventory, sizing a stock target from
observed flow, drawing a per-actor spread, laying out a front-loaded ladder, and
tracking a cost basis.
