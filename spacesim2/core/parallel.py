"""Threaded per-planet actor phase.

Runs each turn's actor phase across a shared-memory thread pool, sharding
planets round-robin. Real parallelism needs a free-threaded CPython build,
3.13t or 3.14t: the actor phase is pure-Python bytecode, so under a GIL the
threads serialize and the phase runs at about serial speed. The code is
correct either way, so tests run on stock interpreters.

Threads are safe here because an actor turn touches only

- the actor's own state: inventory, money, skills, drives, brain memory,
- its own planet's market, to place and cancel orders; matching runs later,
  serially,
- read-only registries: commodities, processes, skills,
- the data logger, written under per-actor keys with a single writer each;
  per-key dict ops are atomic on free-threaded CPython,
- the global order-id counter, wrapped in a lock by market._LockedCounter.

Planets are disjoint across shards, so no market is touched by two threads.
Ships, market matching, and export stay serial in ``Simulation.run_turn``.

Ordering differs from the serial path: each planet's actors are shuffled
independently with a per-shard RNG instead of one global shuffle of
``sim.actors``. Actors never observe another planet during the actor phase,
so this changes only the random stream, not observable behavior. In-actor
code keeps using the global ``random`` module; free-threaded CPython guards
it with an internal lock, which is a known contention point.
