## The Dev Loop

Change, then verify:

```bash
uv run pytest -q                                                  # 1. unit tests (~2s)
uv run spacesim2 run --turns 200 --planets 12 --no-export --quiet --summary    # 2. macro behavior (~30s)
# 3. read JSON between ===SUMMARY_BEGIN=== / ===SUMMARY_END=== (verdict + KPIs)
```

Use `--planets 12` for the routine loop: measured 31 s with verdict PASS on
2026-09-05, and the summary has the same structure as a full run. Drop
`--planets` (100-planet default) only when the question is about the galaxy:
fleet mobility, interplanetary trade, fuel geography. Those KPIs mean nothing
at 12 planets.

### What a run costs

Defaults are 100 planets x 100 actors x 2 makers x 2 operators x 1 ship, and
`--turns` defaults to 1000. Measured serial on the dev laptop:

| Config | Rate | 200 turns | 450 turns |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|
| `--planets 12` | ~0.15 s/turn | ~30 s | ~70 s |
| default 100 planets | ~2 s/turn | ~7 min | ~15 min |
| 100 planets + `--log-actors all` + export | ~4 s/turn | ~15 min | ~35 min |

The Bash tool's default timeout is 120 s (max 600 s). Anything above the first
row needs an explicit `timeout` or `run_in_background: true` on the first
call. `--workers N` threads the actor phase but only helps on a free-threaded
interpreter; see `docs/performance.md`.

`dev check`'s sim stage is separate and cheap: 5 planets x 100 actors x 200
turns, run in-process.

### Shell rules

The shell builtin `cd` is forbidden in Bash commands. A PreToolUse hook
(`hooks/bash-cd-guard.sh`) enforces it: a leading `cd <repo root> &&` is
rewritten away, everything else is denied. Use absolute paths, `git -C DIR`,
`uv run --project DIR`. Never chain `sleep N; command`; give the call an
explicit timeout or `run_in_background: true`. Exclude `.claude/worktrees/`
from searches; it holds stale detached copies of the repo.

`uv run spacesim2 dev check` runs format, lint, types, pytest, and a short
`--summary` sim as one pass/fail gate. It only checks formatting, it does not
rewrite files. Use the three steps above when you need the KPI JSON itself.

- `--summary` prints compact KPI JSON and a `PASS/WARN/FAIL` verdict. When
  exporting it is also written to `summary.json`. Prefer it over a notebook.
- The sim is stochastic and not bit-reproducible. Population means are stable
  to about ±0.05. Assert with tolerances, never exact values. There is no seed
  knob; most randomness comes from `uuid4` and set iteration.
- For open-ended questions write a Tier-1 script and run it with
  `dev analyze`. For human dashboards write a Tier-2 marimo notebook. Durable
  checks go in `tests/test_simulation_smoke.py`. See the `sim-evaluation`
  skill for the tiers and output contract.

The graph command renders with `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`, so Node.js with
`npx` must be on PATH. Output defaults to `tmp/commodity-graph.svg` (gitignored).

## Code Style
- Python 3.11+ with type annotations
- `ruff format`, 88 char lines
- `snake_case` functions and variables, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_CASE` constants
- Domain-driven design; prefer pure functions over stateful classes where it fits

### Tooling
`ruff` handles style (lint and format). `mypy` handles correctness (types).
Do not add a separate formatter.

`hooks/pre-commit` runs `ruff format` and `ruff check` on staged Python files
and `uv run mypy .` over the whole project. mypy is blocking and the project is
clean; keep it that way. A fresh clone must wire the hook once:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

Bypass a single commit with `git commit --no-verify`.

Ruff config: `E501` is ignored because the formatter owns line length.
`notebooks/**` is exempt from lint (still formatted) because marimo's
cross-cell variables trigger false `F401`/`F821`/`I001`.

## Writing

Mannered prose substitutes metaphor and flourish for direct statement. Instead of
"a parameter worth varying", the mannered writer produces "a dial worth turning".
Instead of "this point still matters", they write "this point earns its keep".
The phrases exist to display the writer, not to convey the idea, and readers can
tell. Metaphors drag in connotations the writer did not choose and cannot
control. The fix is to say what you mean. When a literal phrase is available,
use it. Also: state what is true now; do not narrate history or hedge; verify
every flag, path, function, and constant you cite by grepping for it before
you keep the reference.

Prefer a table of numbers to a paragraph about numbers. Lead a report with the
verdict and the 2-5 load-bearing figures. This applies to comments, docstrings,
docs, commit messages, and reports to the user.

## Branching

Work on `main` only. Commit directly to `main`. Do not create feature branches
unless the user asks for one. This overrides the default "branch before
committing on the default branch" behavior.

## Key Architecture Facts

- **Deferred market matching**: orders are matched at the end of the turn, not when placed.
- **Brain pattern**: actors and ships delegate decisions to pluggable `Brain` classes.
- **Core files**: `core/simulation.py` (main loop), `core/actor.py`, `core/ship.py`, `core/market.py`.
- **Star-lane galaxy**: `core/galaxy.py` builds a spiral layout and a connected planar lane graph. `core/navigation.py` routes along lanes, so distance is always the shortest lane route. Ships fly whole routes without docking at intermediate planets. Default is 100 planets (`--planets`, `--arms`, `--lane-density`).

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Commodities
Defined in `data/commodities.yaml`:
```yaml
- id: commodity_name
  name: Display Name
  transportable: true/false
  description: Text description
```

Commodities have no planet-specific attributes. Per-planet availability comes
from Planet Attributes below. Use the `commodity-process-design` skill to
modify commodities or processes.

### Planet Attributes

Every planet gets random attributes at setup. A directly constructed `Planet`
defaults to all availabilities 1.0.

Core file: `core/planet_attributes.py`, `PlanetAttributes` dataclass.

How it works:
1. Each planet gets a random attribute (0.0-1.0) per extractable resource.
2. Gathering processes in `data/processes.yaml` set a `resource_attribute` field.
3. `ProcessCommand.execute()` applies the effect when the process runs.

Attributes: `biomass`, `fiber`, `wood` (organic), `common_metal_ore`,
`nova_fuel_ore` (mineral).

Effect types:
```yaml
resource_attribute:
  commodity: biomass      # which planet attribute to check
  effect: output          # "output" or "success"
```
- `output`: output quantity scales with availability (0.25 gives 25% of base output).
- `success`: the process fails with probability 1 - availability.

Gathering processes (biomass, fiber, wood) use `output`. Mining processes
(nova_fuel_ore, common_metal_ore) use `success`.

Distributions in `PlanetAttributes.generate_random()`: `biomass` is
uniform(0.2, 1.0), `nova_fuel_ore` is bimodal (0.0-0.3 or 0.7-1.0), the rest
are uniform(0.0, 1.0).

Adding a new extractable resource:
1. Add the attribute to `PlanetAttributes` with default 1.0.
2. Add it to the `__post_init__` validation list.
3. Add its distribution to `generate_random()`.
4. Add it to `to_dict()` for export.
5. Add `resource_attribute` to the gathering process in `processes.yaml`.

`planet_attributes.json` is written with the other export files.

### Tool and Facility Requirements

Processes in `data/processes.yaml` specify `tools_required` and
`facilities_required`. The economy has a wood-first bootstrap path, so actors
can start with nothing:

1. Harvest wood (no tools)
2. Make simple tools from wood (no facility)
3. Make building materials from wood (needs tools)
4. Build smelting facility (needs building materials and tools)
5. Mine common metal ore (needs tools)
6. Refine metal (needs smelting facility)
7. Build metalworking facility (needs building materials and tools)
8. Make simple tools from metal (more efficient, needs metalworking facility)

Tools break with 1% probability per use, which keeps tool demand alive.
`ColonistBrain` acquires tools before profitable work. `IndustrialistBrain`
builds the facilities and acquires the tools its chosen recipe needs.

When changing requirements, use the `commodity-process-design` skill and keep
the bootstrap path viable.

### Drives (Needs)

Drives live in `core/drives/` and inherit from `ActorDrive`.

- `FoodDrive` consumes 1 food every turn.
- `ClothingDrive`, `ShelterDrive`, and `HealthDrive` consume on random events
  with probability `BASE_EVENT_PROB` per turn (1/60, 1/120, and 1/90).

Every drive tracks four 0-1 metrics: `health` (immediate status), `debt`
(accumulated neglect), `buffer` (log-normalized days of supply), and `urgency`
(priority multiplier).

Materials: food uses `food`; clothing uses `clothing`; shelter uses
`simple_building_materials` or `prefab_housing`; health uses `medicine` or
`advanced_medicine`.

Adding a drive needs the whole supply chain:
1. Raw material and finished good in `data/commodities.yaml`.
2. Gathering and production processes in `data/processes.yaml`.
3. A drive class in `core/drives/`.
4. `colonist.py` and `industrialist.py` considering the need in `decide_economic_action()`.
5. Brains trading the new commodities (they iterate the registry, so no hardcoded list).

Drives fail silently if their commodity is missing from the registry
(`get_commodity()` returns `None`). Check the commodity exists first.

### Dynamic Commodity Handling

Market makers and actor brains iterate the registry rather than a hardcoded list:

```python
# GOOD
all_commodities = [c for c in actor.sim.commodity_registry.all_commodities() if c.transportable]
for commodity in all_commodities:
    ...

# BAD
for commodity in (food, fuel, wood):
    ...
```

### Shared Brain Logic

Algorithms shared between brains go in a module of plain functions, never a
shared base class. `core/brains/dealer.py` is the pattern: `market_maker_2.py`
and `spaceport_operator.py` both import it and call its functions; neither
inherits from anything in it.

### Performance Changes

An optimization must not change what any actor decides (exact semantics).
Per-actor valuation stays per-actor. A shared cache is allowed only when every
actor at the same cache version would compute identical values. Write an
equivalence test that compares the optimized path against a brute-force
reference; `TestBestProcessRankedWalkEquivalence` and
`TestReplacementCostSplitEquivalence` in
`tests/test_registry_and_brain_cache.py` are the existing examples.

## Analysis

The default loop is the Dev Loop above: `--summary` for the verdict, a
`dev analyze` script for open-ended questions. Marimo notebooks are an optional
human-facing dashboard.

```bash
uv run spacesim2 run --notebook          # export and open notebooks/analysis_template.py
# or
uv run spacesim2 run
uv run marimo edit --no-token notebooks/analysis_template.py   # finds the latest run via SPACESIM_RUN_PATH
```

Before handing a notebook to the user, run `uv run marimo check` on it and
start the server. Marimo pitfalls: prefix cell-local variables with `_`,
assign conditional outputs to a named variable before displaying, and do not
return unused variables.

When to use what:
- `--summary`: did my change break the economy?
- `dev analyze` script: open-ended behavioral questions, debugging
- `dev ab`: did my change move the KPI, or is that noise?
- Marimo notebook: interactive charts for a human
- pytest: durable assertions, for example:
```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    sim = Simulation()
    sim.setup_simple(num_planets=2, num_regular_actors=10, num_market_makers=1, num_ships=1)
    sim.run_turn()
    # ... assertions
```
