"""Would the ration branch have found a cheap pump, or a fair price, instead
of paying the spike.

Tier-1b in-process probe, sizing step 2 of the fuel refueling rework
(scratchpad/fuel_brief.md). ``TraderBrain._opportunistic_fuel_topup`` has two
branches: bunkering (ask within FUEL_BUNKER_PREMIUM of the galaxy reference)
and the ration branch (ask above that). This probe wraps the ration branch
only and, at the moment each ration buy order is placed, records the state
the order was placed under, then runs two independent analyses over the same
recorded orders:

1. Cheap-pump analysis (``by_reachability_*``, ``by_target_component``,
   ``pump_distance_stats``): which target set the order's size (the survival
   target vs a committed destination's fuel need), the ship's tank and
   capacity, and whether a "cheap pump" - a planet with a resting fuel ask at
   or below FUEL_BUNKER_PREMIUM times the reference and real supply evidence
   - was reachable either on the ship's current tank or from its committed
   destination after arrival. Fills are matched back to orders through
   ``Transaction.buy_order_id``, the same mechanism ship_fuel_path_probe.py
   uses.

2. Wait-for-fair-price analysis (``by_cap_and_wait``, ``wait_failures``):
   for orders whose ask/reference ratio exceeds a cap (2x, 3x tested), would
   a standing bid at a fair price (1.5x reference, or the planet's own
   30-day average) have filled within N turns (3, 5, 8 tested) had the ship
   waited instead of lifting the spiked ask? Answered by recording every
   nova_fuel trade at every planet during the run and looking forward from
   each order's turn. Orders are counted whether or not they filled, since
   the question is about the road not taken.

Two supply-evidence tests are recorded for the pump search: depth
(``Navigator.fuel_ask_depth_at`` >= 5, the design's threshold) and the
weaker recency signal (``Navigator.fuel_traded_recently``). Pump aggregates
use the depth test unless labelled "weak".

    uv run python notebooks/ship_fuel_cheap_pump_probe.py --turns 300 \\
