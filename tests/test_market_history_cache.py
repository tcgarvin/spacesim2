"""Tests for the float stdev rewrite and the per-turn history-read memo.

The five trade-history-derived reads (get_avg_price, has_price_signal,
get_30_day_average_price, get_30_day_average_volume,
get_30_day_standard_deviation) are memoized per turn; the memo must be
invalidated by both set_current_turn and match_orders so callers always see
values identical to an uncached computation.
