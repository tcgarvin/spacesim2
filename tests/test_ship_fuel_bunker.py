"""Bunker buying: bid price, budget tiers, and lingering to fill the tank.

- A fuel bid is posted at max(local ask, recent clearing price), so it wins
  units out of the turn's flow instead of only the resting book.
- The larger bunker budget applies only when the ask is at or below the
  galaxy fuel reference.
- A ship ready to depart may stay one extra docked turn to buy cheap fuel,
  but not with a full-enough tank, not at a spiked ask, and not twice at the
  same stop.
