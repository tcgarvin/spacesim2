"""Displacement bids: an actor that hand-makes a need good also bids for it.

See ``ActorBrain._displacement_bid_commands``. A need gate that spends a
labor turn cooking food leaves no market demand behind, so nothing is
shipped in and the actor cooks again next turn. The bid is sized to the run
the purchase would displace and priced with the actor's own opportunity cost
of a labor turn.
