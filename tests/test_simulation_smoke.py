"""Macro behavioral smoke test for the simulation.

Asserts on population-wide outcomes via the KPI summary, so an economy change
that passes every unit test but wrecks aggregate behavior still fails here.

The simulation is stochastic and has no run-level seed, so assertions use
tolerances, not exact values. Keep the run short so the suite stays fast.
