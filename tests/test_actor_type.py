"""Every actor's ActorType must agree with what its brain implies.

ActorType is a coarse "population vs infrastructure" split (REGULAR vs
SERVICE); this test pins the mapping from brain class to expected
ActorType so future brains are added deliberately rather than silently
falling on the wrong side of the split.
