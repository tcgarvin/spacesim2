"""Tests for the idle-ship livelock fixes in ``TraderBrain``.

Mechanisms that used to keep a ship with cargo docked forever:

- the "selling locally" travel veto, which was meant to protect the sell
  orders placed this turn but never expired,
- the hold-or-sell comparison judging destinations on the fuel in the tank
  alone, which rejected almost every destination for a ship running near its
  survival fuel target, and
- committing to only the outbound leg of fuel, which the departure gate then
  refused for the arrival reserve the ship had never funded.

Plus the hazards the escape from that livelock opened: replanning in the
same turn as a local sale must not have the ship bidding for its own cargo,
and the staleness clock must turn on fills, not on the sellable total.
